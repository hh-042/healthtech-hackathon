# healthtech-hackathon

This repository contains the code and data used to create a website which predicts EXPAR DNA template performance using an LLM-XGBoost model. This project was developed as part of the HealthTech AI Hub hackathon in collaboration with ExGen Dx (formerly Linear Diagnostics Ltd). 

This project builds on previous work: Qian J. et al. Sequence dependence of isothermal DNA amplification via EXPAR. Nucleic Acids Research. 2012;40(11). https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gks230
