    Generates DNA sequences using Google Gemini API with specified parameters.

    Returns:

    Generate exactly {num_sequences} DNA template sequences.  
    Each sequence must:
    - Be **on a new line** (one per line).
    - Follow this structure:
      - Starts with 10-15 base sequence
      - Followed by 4 random A,T,C,G bases
      - Followed by 5 specific cutting bases ("GACTC")
      - Followed by a 10-15 base sequence that matches the start
    - Ensure Tm (melting temperature) is between 50-60Â°C.
    - Ensure Diff (N10 - P90) is positive and large.
    **Output:** Provide only the sequences, no extra text, formatted with one sequence per line.
